(3, 'Do\'s & Don\'ts', '<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">Security is not as straightforward as it once was. At aammsecurities, we encounter cyber security risks on a daily basis. The dangers are increasing in number and sophistication, and the danger is quite real.&nbsp;The days of a virus writer developing infections for &quot;fun,&quot; political, or anti-establishment motives are long gone; nowadays, it is a major business, whether consumers pay to decrypt their data or send money to a fraudster &ndash; which happens every day.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">While technology and software can help mitigate risk, the risk can never be completely eliminated, owing mostly to human behaviour and social engineering. This is how the vast majority of large-scale scams are perpetrated. Criminals initiate frauds, but the victim frequently assists them. Consider what someone is requesting of you. If you are requested to click a link, open a file, pay money, or verify information, STOP AND CONSIDER.</span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We provide prevention techniques and countermeasures against malware/ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering and data manipulation attacks .</span></span></p>\r\n', '<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><a name=\"_Toc80752979\"></a><a name=\"_Toc81416204\">Countermeasures to Malware Attacks</a></span></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Training of the users minimizes the danger of infection. The typical route for a ransomware attack begins with a fraudulent email. Once users have been taught, they will recognize and avoid some of their attack methods. Social engineering is an assault that focuses on more privileged users on the network. It is assumed that these individuals have essential company or personal data stored locally or have access to crucial systems and infrastructure. The likelihood that the firm will pay the ransom grows as a result. Installing the latest patch is especially important for firmware, anti-malware programs, operating systems, and third-party software. New ransomware versions are created constantly, and most anti-malware programs include anti-worm/anti-virus capabilities that identify newer ransomware variants. Restoring data from a backup is the best approach to recover against ransomware. If backups restore data from an alternate source, then it bypasses the ransom demand. A hacker would do this because backup files are standard. Thus, a ransomware virus monitors the network for these files. Even when a backup has been restored, the network must be decontaminated of the ransomware. Keeping a separate backup copy offshore prevents Malware from encrypting backup files. For companies, remote cloud backups are typically the preferred backup method. Storing information in the cloud lets users be protected from ransomware and other security risks, including viruses. Typically, malware attacks originate via executables or scripts that are used to download and execute the program. Ransomware attacks are not always immediate. Ransomware such as CryptoLocker might lie dormant until a specific date. A wide range of programs is used to identify ransomware on a network. Malware creates a massive number of files whose names have been changed. There are dozens of different forms of ransomware viruses that may be detected by anti-malware software. The signatures in the encrypted file detect ransomware before it is allowed to run. Zero-day attacks that target vulnerabilities developers have not yet discovered they are not always seen&mdash;current anti-malware solutions, including artificial intelligence (ai), machine learning, and behaviour monitoring. The results of these tests measure the current file state against the addition and deletion of files and access requests. They notify administrators of possible attack activity in order to avert data encryption and destruction of files. As an effective way to combat ransomware, utilize anti-malware software, frequent file backups, and user training. Even while no cyber defences can guarantee total protection, users can drastically minimize the likelihood of a successful assault</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><a name=\"_Toc80752989\"></a><a name=\"_Toc81416215\">Countermeasures to </a>Social Engineering </span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Social engineering attacks make use of human interaction.

They have till now to go over the email and assess it. Let the screen capture fly over the URL and hover over it. Check to see if anything looks wrong and report it if so. Check the email&#39;s &quot;return-path&quot; and &quot;reply-to&quot; fields to determine where users got their email. Even if they do not use email, they should sandbox to be safe. Fraudulent emails will not be clicked if customers do not trust the emails their bank sends and do not allow any attachments except personal salutations, such as &#39;Dear [first name],&#39; to download. They also do not allow attachment downloads that might lead to further issues. Automatic transaction numbers are issued when users issue a request for transaction details in online banking. Also, since phishing attempts have no chance, they are pointless.<a name=\"_Toc80753002\"></a><a name=\"_Toc81416228\"></a></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong>Countermeasures to Data-Manipulation</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Using an encrypted method to convey sensitive and essential data is one way to use encryption. If the user would like, it may also use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or an equivalent like GPG. While WinZip and 7-zip are good archiving tools, encryption using AES-256 with a pre-shared key that is only delivered in an encrypted email message does the trick. Authentication, Both sides of a communication stream or transaction should use digital certificates to authenticate each other. Letting that happen allows users to guarantee that both the person to whom sending it and the person receiving it from are whom they say they are and that the channel is encrypted. In addition, it is beneficial for the distribution of data via automatic means. For example, financial transactions must occur between two software applications operating in different places. The information must be protected so that it does not get into the wrong hands. It is crucial and critical information that cannot be trusted to be sent only via routes that cannot be hacked. To ensure that a request is genuine, that the requestor is permitted to receive it, and that the sender is authorized to submit it, a user must contact the requestor personally. Procedural documentation should include several checks in order to decrease the risk.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"page-break-after:always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2021-09-14 07:31:22');

(1, '<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">The rapid digital transformation of the banking industry has increased the potential attack surface, exposing firms to cyber threats. As more organizations utilize digital banking, having robust cybersecurity policies is critical. Understanding which threat trends provide the most significant risk to your bank or financial institution is critical to the success of these programs informed security tactics that appropriately analyze the organization&#39;s cyberhealth. Enabling the bank to embrace digital transformation without compromising security or compliance is possible with security monitoring software.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">The banking industry&#39;s cyber threat landscape</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting consumer banking credentials while carrying out attacks due to the increased value of financial data. Mobile banking applications used by more banks on the network create new weaknesses for hackers to exploit. Both client-side and server-side attacks may be employed against banking apps, making them especially challenging to defend. The same rules that apply to devices apply to servers as well. Bank customers should be wary of fraudsters who will also seek to attack the bank&#39;s third-party providers (software vendors, banking equipment vendors, customer service vendors). Threat actors typically target vendors because they have access to sensitive banking data, which may often be found on the vendor&#39;s systems. Monitoring the cybersecurity of banks that depend on third parties is critical. The proper level of due diligence applied to vendors may safeguard financial companies from damage to their reputation and significant financial loss.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:15.0pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Three significant threats that banks should be aware of are as follows.&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Malware</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Malware has for a long time threatened the financial sector. Malware is being used to infect weak user devices, allowing thieves to access a complete banking network and steal valuable user data. More recently, malware has been easier to get, and it has thus risen in prominence since it was the Cause of more than 75% of all data breaches in the banking industry in 2019. Due to the rapid expansion of malware-as-a-service and file-less malware assaults, it is apparent that banks and financial institutions require robust security measures. A crucial step in ensuring that the devices of both customers and employees cannot be compromised is for banks to cooperate with their security teams to configure security systems to prevent both customers and employees from being infected by malware.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Phishing</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Social engineering attacks are a unique type of hacking since they use human behavior to access corporate computers. Employees&#39; passwords and other critical information are stolen by social engineers who exploit the information to infiltrate the network. Banking is a popular target for social engineering attacks, namely phishing. Fake emails, phone calls, and messages sent by imposters attempt to mislead corporate personnel into revealing confidential information. Not only may phishing assaults utilize incorrect URLs to trick employees into downloading malware on their systems, but this method can also be used to install malware. In phishing attempts, customers are commonly targeted. Thus it must educate customers about cybersecurity best practices. A security awareness newsletter or email can be used to disseminate this information.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Data Manipulation</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Many people believe that just data theft is what worries them about cyber assaults. While data manipulation assaults have become a standard attack for hackers, that is not always the case. Attackers that successfully infiltrate a target system make undetectable alterations to data on their behalf for personal benefit. For example, if an employee updates customer transactional data, it illustrates this principle in operation. The transactions will likely go unreported since people will perceive them as legitimate, resulting in subsequent data entries being incorrect. As the manipulation continues to go unnoticed, it will inflict more significant harm. These attacks are difficult to detect and avoid because altered data look no different than standard data. In the financial business, deliberate data manipulation can lead to severe fines and non-compliance with data standards.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Find out how to ensure banking institution is safe from cyber-attacks.</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Multi-factor Authentication</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Multi-factor authentication requires the user to provide two or more different forms of authentication yet only grants access once. Passwords, pins, and fingerprints are all accepted as logins. To protect the security of MFA, avoid logging in with the same credentials (i.e., two passwords) as this weakens it. Additionally, MFA offers another degree of protection while accessing valuable information to protect customers&#39; information.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cyber risk assessment</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">To do a cyber risk assessment, businesses should survey their network&#39;s vulnerabilities. To identify the main threats to the organization, evaluate the company&#39;s vulnerability, prioritize repair activities, and streamline threat mitigation. This ensures that can proactively guard against data breaches while saving expenses and reducing worker hours. Regulations and industry standards necessitate &quot;continuous monitoring&quot; as a result of mounting risks to data. Organizations are reminded of possible dangers by the presence of articles and blog postings, which call attention to weaknesses. Many individuals, however, view security vulnerabilities as theoretical rather than concrete tasks. All of the organization is IT, and business executives must speak the same language regarding information.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSecurity and have mutual knowledge of what it means to do vulnerability management to work together to safeguard sensitive data.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cyber insurance</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cyber insurance is a must for a cybersecurity plan since it helps guarantee that organizations are financially covered in a data breach. Not only does cyber insurance warn consumers of data breaches, but it also informs them of regulatory requirements, which companies must comply with to stay by data privacy rules. Also, cyber insurance will cover the cost of repairing damaged systems and restore. To safeguard enterprises against data breaches, companies rely on cyber insurance. Cyber insurance plans remain naturally hesitant to be issued since understanding the client&#39;s cyber health might be challenging. Better risk management and constant monitoring of customers are two results that accurate security ratings may produce for carriers, reinsurers, brokers, and risk managers. Because such valuable data is involved, the financial services sector has been a frequent target for hackers. Financial institutions that store personal financial information (PII) on their systems is vulnerable to a compromise without the proper cybersecurity safeguards. Banks and other financial institutions are at risk of substantial penalties and loss of reputation in the case of a breach. Therefore compliance is a significant issue. Therefore, in the financial services business, compliance with cybersecurity standards is critical. An efficient cybersecurity compliance program would help banks comply with laws put in place by different government organizations while safeguarding critical assets. This means that companies will avoid penalties by ensuring compliance with established banking standards.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Employee training</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Companies must train the workers on cyber hygiene best practices for all information security measures to be effective. Employee training can also help to reduce the consequences of a data leak. Train staff to utilize their cybersecurity systems effectively, and they may detect and help patch flaws before they can be exploited. For many years, hackers have targeted financial institutions because of the wealth of valuable information housed on their networks. However, the digital revolution in the business has seen a rise in assaults. As banks integrate digital solutions, the number of places at which hackers may launch an assault increases. Many financial institutions can no longer safeguard essential data such as credit card information, banking statements, and client social security numbers because legacy systems are no longer equipped to resist today&#39;s sophisticated cyber-attacks. Financial institutions must put cyber hygiene at the top of their priority list to facilitate a secure digital transition. Companies will be better equipped to find and fix vulnerabilities in their internal and third-party ecosystems by using cybersecurity strategies. To fulfill the client&#39;s demand for innovation, businesses will maintain secure and compliant operations while offering new financial products. If the organization uses third-party suppliers to execute commercial operations, it must keep an eye on the cybersecurity of those third-party vendors. An organization&#39;s approach to cybersecurity may be evaluated using questionnaires that gather the information needed. It is, however, labor-intensive to create surveys that are vendor-specific.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">To make matters worse, most companies establish security policies to promote software development. Guidelines established to mitigate cybersecurity risk serve as a reference for suppliers. Using these standards, assessing third-party vendor risk gives a more realistic picture of each company&#39;s risk, helping to cut down on questionnaire management time.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">&emsp;<br />\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">How can aammsecurities help?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Banks need visibility into their cybersecurity ecosystems in order to effectively protect themselves against threats.

As more organizations utilize digital banking, having robust cybersecurity policies is critical. Understanding which threat trends provide the most significant risk to your bank or financial institution is critical to the success of these programs informed security tactics that appropriately analyze the organization&#39;s cyberhealth. Enabling the bank to embrace digital transformation without compromising security or compliance is possible with security monitoring software.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">The banking industry&#39;s cyber threat landscape</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting consumer banking credentials while carrying out attacks due to the increased value of financial data. Mobile banking applications used by more banks on the network create new weaknesses for hackers to exploit. Both client-side and server-side attacks may be employed against banking apps, making them especially challenging to defend. The same rules that apply to devices apply to servers as well. Bank customers should be wary of fraudsters who will also seek to attack the bank&#39;s third-party providers (software vendors, banking equipment vendors, customer service vendors). Threat actors typically target vendors because they have access to sensitive banking data, which may often be found on the vendor&#39;s systems. Monitoring the cybersecurity of banks that depend on third parties is critical. The proper level of due diligence applied to vendors may safeguard financial companies from damage to their reputation and significant financial loss.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:15.0pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Three significant threats that banks should be aware of are as follows.&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Malware</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Malware has for a long time threatened the financial sector. Malware is being used to infect weak user devices, allowing thieves to access a complete banking network and steal valuable user data. More recently, malware has been easier to get, and it has thus risen in prominence since it was the Cause of more than 75% of all data breaches in the banking industry in 2019. Due to the rapid expansion of malware-as-a-service and file-less malware assaults, it is apparent that banks and financial institutions require robust security measures. A crucial step in ensuring that the devices of both customers and employees cannot be compromised is for banks to cooperate with their security teams to configure security systems to prevent both customers and employees from being infected by malware.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Phishing</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Social engineering attacks are a unique type of hacking since they use human behavior to access corporate computers. Employees&#39; passwords and other critical information are stolen by social engineers who exploit the information to infiltrate the network. Banking is a popular target for social engineering attacks, namely phishing. Fake emails, phone calls, and messages sent by imposters attempt to mislead corporate personnel into revealing confidential information. Not only may phishing assaults utilize incorrect URLs to trick employees into downloading malware on their systems, but this method can also be used to install malware. In phishing attempts, customers are commonly targeted. Thus it must educate customers about cybersecurity best practices. A security awareness newsletter or email can be used to disseminate this information.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Data Manipulation</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Many people believe that just data theft is what worries them about cyber assaults. While data manipulation assaults have become a standard attack for hackers, that is not always the case. Attackers that successfully infiltrate a target system make undetectable alterations to data on their behalf for personal benefit. For example, if an employee updates customer transactional data, it illustrates this principle in operation. The transactions will likely go unreported since people will perceive them as legitimate, resulting in subsequent data entries being incorrect. As the manipulation continues to go unnoticed, it will inflict more significant harm. These attacks are difficult to detect and avoid because altered data look no different than standard data. In the financial business, deliberate data manipulation can lead to severe fines and non-compliance with data standards.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Find out how to ensure banking institution is safe from cyber-attacks.</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Multi-factor Authentication</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Multi-factor authentication requires the user to provide two or more different forms of authentication yet only grants access once. Passwords, pins, and fingerprints are all accepted as logins. To protect the security of MFA, avoid logging in with the same credentials (i.e., two passwords) as this weakens it. Additionally, MFA offers another degree of protection while accessing valuable information to protect customers&#39; information.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cyber risk assessment</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">To do a cyber risk assessment, businesses should survey their network&#39;s vulnerabilities. To identify the main threats to the organization, evaluate the company&#39;s vulnerability, prioritize repair activities, and streamline threat mitigation. This ensures that can proactively guard against data breaches while saving expenses and reducing worker hours. Regulations and industry standards necessitate &quot;continuous monitoring&quot; as a result of mounting risks to data. Organizations are reminded of possible dangers by the presence of articles and blog postings, which call attention to weaknesses. Many individuals, however, view security vulnerabilities as theoretical rather than concrete tasks. All of the organization is IT, and business executives must speak the same language regarding information.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSecurity and have mutual knowledge of what it means to do vulnerability management to work together to safeguard sensitive data.</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cyber insurance</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Cyber insurance is a must for a cybersecurity plan since it helps guarantee that organizations are financially covered in a data breach. Not only does cyber insurance warn consumers of data breaches, but it also informs them of regulatory requirements, which companies must comply with to stay by data privacy rules. Also, cyber insurance will cover the cost of repairing damaged systems and restore. To safeguard enterprises against data breaches, companies rely on cyber insurance. Cyber insurance plans remain naturally hesitant to be issued since understanding the client&#39;s cyber health might be challenging. Better risk management and constant monitoring of customers are two results that accurate security ratings may produce for carriers, reinsurers, brokers, and risk managers. Because such valuable data is involved, the financial services sector has been a frequent target for hackers. Financial institutions that store personal financial information (PII) on their systems is vulnerable to a compromise without the proper cybersecurity safeguards. Banks and other financial institutions are at risk of substantial penalties and loss of reputation in the case of a breach. Therefore compliance is a significant issue. Therefore, in the financial services business, compliance with cybersecurity standards is critical. An efficient cybersecurity compliance program would help banks comply with laws put in place by different government organizations while safeguarding critical assets. This means that companies will avoid penalties by ensuring compliance with established banking standards.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Employee training</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Companies must train the workers on cyber hygiene best practices for all information security measures to be effective. Employee training can also help to reduce the consequences of a data leak. Train staff to utilize their cybersecurity systems effectively, and they may detect and help patch flaws before they can be exploited. For many years, hackers have targeted financial institutions because of the wealth of valuable information housed on their networks. However, the digital revolution in the business has seen a rise in assaults. As banks integrate digital solutions, the number of places at which hackers may launch an assault increases. Many financial institutions can no longer safeguard essential data such as credit card information, banking statements, and client social security numbers because legacy systems are no longer equipped to resist today&#39;s sophisticated cyber-attacks. Financial institutions must put cyber hygiene at the top of their priority list to facilitate a secure digital transition. Companies will be better equipped to find and fix vulnerabilities in their internal and third-party ecosystems by using cybersecurity strategies. To fulfill the client&#39;s demand for innovation, businesses will maintain secure and compliant operations while offering new financial products. If the organization uses third-party suppliers to execute commercial operations, it must keep an eye on the cybersecurity of those third-party vendors. An organization&#39;s approach to cybersecurity may be evaluated using questionnaires that gather the information needed. It is, however, labor-intensive to create surveys that are vendor-specific.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">To make matters worse, most companies establish security policies to promote software development. Guidelines established to mitigate cybersecurity risk serve as a reference for suppliers. Using these standards, assessing third-party vendor risk gives a more realistic picture of each company&#39;s risk, helping to cut down on questionnaire management time.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">&emsp;<br />\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:16.5pt\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">How can aammsecurities help?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Banks need visibility into their cybersecurity ecosystems in order to effectively protect themselves against threats.

At aammsecurities, we encounter cyber security risks on a daily basis. The dangers are increasing in number and sophistication, and the danger is quite real.&nbsp;The days of a virus writer developing infections for &quot;fun,&quot; political, or anti-establishment motives are long gone; nowadays, it is a major business, whether consumers pay to decrypt their data or send money to a fraudster &ndash; which happens every day.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">While technology and software can help mitigate risk, the risk can never be completely eliminated, owing mostly to human behaviour and social engineering.

If you are requested to click a link, open a file, pay money, or verify information, STOP AND CONSIDER.</span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">We provide prevention techniques and countermeasures against malware/ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering and data manipulation attacks .</span></span></p>\r\n', '<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\"><a name=\"_Toc80752979\"></a><a name=\"_Toc81416204\">Countermeasures to Malware Attacks</a></span></span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Training of the users minimizes the danger of infection. The typical route for a ransomware attack begins with a fraudulent email. Once users have been taught, they will recognize and avoid some of their attack methods. Social engineering is an assault that focuses on more privileged users on the network. It is assumed that these individuals have essential company or personal data stored locally or have access to crucial systems and infrastructure. The likelihood that the firm will pay the ransom grows as a result. Installing the latest patch is especially important for firmware, anti-malware programs, operating systems, and third-party software. New ransomware versions are created constantly, and most anti-malware programs include anti-worm/anti-virus capabilities that identify newer ransomware variants. Restoring data from a backup is the best approach to recover against ransomware. If backups restore data from an alternate source, then it bypasses the ransom demand. A hacker would do this because backup files are standard. Thus, a ransomware virus monitors the network for these files. Even when a backup has been restored, the network must be decontaminated of the ransomware. Keeping a separate backup copy offshore prevents Malware from encrypting backup files. For companies, remote cloud backups are typically the preferred backup method. Storing information in the cloud lets users be protected from ransomware and other security risks, including viruses. Typically, malware attacks originate via executables or scripts that are used to download and execute the program. Ransomware attacks are not always immediate. Ransomware such as CryptoLocker might lie dormant until a specific date. A wide range of programs is used to identify ransomware on a network. Malware creates a massive number of files whose names have been changed. There are dozens of different forms of ransomware viruses that may be detected by anti-malware software. The signatures in the encrypted file detect ransomware before it is allowed to run. Zero-day attacks that target vulnerabilities developers have not yet discovered they are not always seen&mdash;current anti-malware solutions, including artificial intelligence (ai), machine learning, and behaviour monitoring. The results of these tests measure the current file state against the addition and deletion of files and access requests. They notify administrators of possible attack activity in order to avert data encryption and destruction of files. As an effective way to combat ransomware, utilize anti-malware software, frequent file backups, and user training. Even while no cyber defences can guarantee total protection, users can drastically minimize the likelihood of a successful assault</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:22px\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,sans-serif\"><a name=\"_Toc80752989\"></a><a name=\"_Toc81416215\">Countermeasures to </a>Social Engineering </span></span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\">Social engineering attacks make use of human interaction.

They have till now to go over the email and assess it. Let the screen capture fly over the URL and hover over it. Check to see if anything looks wrong and report it if so. Check the email&#39;s &quot;return-path&quot; and &quot;reply-to&quot; fields to determine where users got their email. Even if they do not use email, they should sandbox to be safe. Fraudulent emails will not be clicked if customers do not trust the emails their bank sends and do not allow any attachments except personal salutations, such as &#39;Dear [first name],&#39; to download. They also do not allow attachment downloads that might lead to further issues. Automatic transaction numbers are issued when users issue a request for transaction details in online banking.

If the user would like, it may also use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or an equivalent like GPG. While WinZip and 7-zip are good archiving tools, encryption using AES-256 with a pre-shared key that is only delivered in an encrypted email message does the trick. Authentication, Both sides of a communication stream or transaction should use digital certificates to authenticate each other. Letting that happen allows users to guarantee that both the person to whom sending it and the person receiving it from are whom they say they are and that the channel is encrypted. In addition, it is beneficial for the distribution of data via automatic means. For example, financial transactions must occur between two software applications operating in different places. The information must be protected so that it does not get into the wrong hands. It is crucial and critical information that cannot be trusted to be sent only via routes that cannot be hacked. To ensure that a request is genuine, that the requestor is permitted to receive it, and that the sender is authorized to submit it, a user must contact the requestor personally. Procedural documentation should include several checks in order to decrease the risk.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"page-break-after:always\"><span style=\"display:none\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'dos-donts', 5, 8, 0, NULL, NULL),
