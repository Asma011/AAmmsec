            <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Our approach to resolving cyber incidents is clear. Prevention, detection, forensic and recovery </span></span></p>
            
            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Prevention, detection, and forensic response form the four-part cybernetic defensive cycle. The four primary approaches to identify, cope, and deal with an issue are prevention, detection, reaction, and forensic.</span></span></p>
            
            <ol>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The prevention is continuously monitored in order to discover any potential vulnerability or malfunction.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;The detection segment includes network IDS (such as Network IDS), host-based IDS (such as Host base IDS), signature-based IDS (such as Signature-based IDS), and anomaly-based IDS (such as Anomaly-based IDS). Good or malicious traffic on our server is detectable using Wireshark, telling us about the attacker.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">This uses the response phase to get rid of the assault rapidly.</span></span></li>

            <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">During an assault, when a system is healed and then healed again, the forensic phase is utilized</span></span></p>

            <p style="margin-left:24px; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:22px"><strong>Our both technological and tactical approaches.</strong></span></span></p>

The monitored system contains the system configuration, including the network topology and configuration</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The number of sensors that convey all control system events to the processing environment.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Intrusion signals, software upgrades, and hardware installs are all elements of these kinds of events.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">These products include IDS, Antivirus (AV), and firmware.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Countermeasures like blocking TCP/UDP ports, diverting inbound traffic, or putting in a route may be implemented in order to mitigate possible acknowledgement of receipt issues.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Responding to vulnerability also includes measuring and monitoring the vulnerability response. Network topology is accurate.</span></span></li>
                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Verifying technical data that has not been prepared and turned into remedial activities and generating a list of possible countermeasures will all be performed.</span></span></li>

                <li style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The balance between the expense of the reaction and the machine&#39;s safety phase is in the Select action for countermeasures. Additionally, the presence of non-compliance becomes a concern when determining the monetary worth of activating the specified motions, as compliance reduction has the potential to decrease the provision of certain services potentially. Separate and evaluate various defence methods for a particular assault and see whether they may be the most useful, the most cost-effective, the most limit-compliant, or the most profitable.</span></span></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It is equally vital to utilize modern and secure software to detect assault, not only to keep data safe. Wireshark may also be used for the identification of attacker exploits</span></span></p>
