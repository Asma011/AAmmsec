At aammsecurities, we encounter cyber security risks on a daily basis. The dangers are increasing in number and sophistication, and the danger is quite real.&nbsp;The days of a virus writer developing infections for &quot;fun,&quot; political, or anti-establishment motives are long gone; nowadays, it is a major business, whether consumers pay to decrypt their data or send money to a fraudster &ndash; which happens every day.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">While technology and software can help mitigate risk, the risk can never be completely eliminated, owing mostly to human behaviour and social engineering. This is how the vast majority of large-scale scams are perpetrated. Criminals initiate frauds, but the victim frequently assists them. Consider what someone is requesting of you. If you are requested to click a link, open a file, pay money, or verify information, STOP AND CONSIDER.</span><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">We provide prevention techniques and countermeasures against malware/ransomware attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering and data manipulation attacks .</span></span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Training of the users minimizes the danger of infection. The typical route for a ransomware attack begins with a fraudulent email. Once users have been taught, they will recognize and avoid some of their attack methods. Social engineering is an assault that focuses on more privileged users on the network. It is assumed that these individuals have essential company or personal data stored locally or have access to crucial systems and infrastructure. The likelihood that the firm will pay the ransom grows as a result. Installing the latest patch is especially important for firmware, anti-malware programs, operating systems, and third-party software. New ransomware versions are created constantly, and most anti-malware programs include anti-worm/anti-virus capabilities that identify newer ransomware variants. Restoring data from a backup is the best approach to recover against ransomware. If backups restore data from an alternate source, then it bypasses the ransom demand. A hacker would do this because backup files are standard. Thus, a ransomware virus monitors the network for these files. Even when a backup has been restored, the network must be decontaminated of the ransomware. Keeping a separate backup copy offshore prevents Malware from encrypting backup files. For companies, remote cloud backups are typically the preferred backup method. Storing information in the cloud lets users be protected from ransomware and other security risks, including viruses. Typically, malware attacks originate via executables or scripts that are used to download and execute the program. Ransomware attacks are not always immediate. Ransomware such as CryptoLocker might lie dormant until a specific date. A wide range of programs is used to identify ransomware on a network. Malware creates a massive number of files whose names have been changed. There are dozens of different forms of ransomware viruses that may be detected by anti-malware software. The signatures in the encrypted file detect ransomware before it is allowed to run. Zero-day attacks that target vulnerabilities developers have not yet discovered they are not always seen&mdash;current anti-malware solutions, including artificial intelligence (ai), machine learning, and behaviour monitoring. The results of these tests measure the current file state against the addition and deletion of files and access requests. They notify administrators of possible attack activity in order to avert data encryption and destruction of files. As an effective way to combat ransomware, utilize anti-malware software, frequent file backups, and user training. Even while no cyber defences can guarantee total protection, users can drastically minimize the likelihood of a successful assault</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">When consumers have several unread messages, they should never assume that they have not yet viewed the email because of their stress or other competing messages. They have till now to go over the email and assess it. Let the screen capture fly over the URL and hover over it. Check to see if anything looks wrong and report it if so. Check the email&#39;s &quot;return-path&quot; and &quot;reply-to&quot; fields to determine where users got their email. Even if they do not use email, they should sandbox to be safe. Fraudulent emails will not be clicked if customers do not trust the emails their bank sends and do not allow any attachments except personal salutations, such as &#39;Dear [first name],&#39; to download. They also do not allow attachment downloads that might lead to further issues. Automatic transaction numbers are issued when users issue a request for transaction details in online banking. Also, since phishing attempts have no chance, they are pointless.<a name="_Toc80753002"></a><a name="_Toc81416228"></a></span></span></span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Countermeasures to Data-Manipulation</strong></span></span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Using an encrypted method to convey sensitive and essential data is one way to use encryption. If the user would like, it may also use Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or an equivalent like GPG. While WinZip and 7-zip are good archiving tools, encryption using AES-256 with a pre-shared key that is only delivered in an encrypted email message does the trick. Authentication, Both sides of a communication stream or transaction should use digital certificates to authenticate each other. Letting that happen allows users to guarantee that both the person to whom sending it and the person receiving it from are whom they say they are and that the channel is encrypted. In addition, it is beneficial for the distribution of data via automatic means. For example, financial transactions must occur between two software applications operating in different places. The information must be protected so that it does not get into the wrong hands. It is crucial and critical information that cannot be trusted to be sent only via routes that cannot be hacked. To ensure that a request is genuine, that the requestor is permitted to receive it, and that the sender is authorized to submit it, a user must contact the requestor personally. Procedural documentation should include several checks in order to decrease the risk.</span></span></span></p>
